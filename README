WHAT
----
This Python hook controls a Blackmagic Design SmartScope Duo 4K from Autodesk Flame,
allowing you to switch what each monitor is displaying from a variety of presets.


HOW
---
SmartScope-Flame Controller uses a Python hook in Autodesk Flame/Flame Assist/Flare
to add a "SmartScope Duo" context menu in the application.  Communication is done
via Ethernet, so your SmartScope must be on the network.

To install, first place smartscope-flame.py in the Flame's python directory:

  /usr/discreet/flame_2016.2/python/

where 'flame_2016.2' will vary depending on your specific application and version.
Technically this script can be placed anywhere but it's convenient to keep it with
the rest of Flame's Python code.  Note that you might need to be root to do this.

Next, edit smartscope-flame.py in a text editor and modify the config variable
near the top to tell it how to reach your SmartScope:

  #### Configuration ####
  ssdc_hostname = '192.168.1.1'  # IP or hostname
  ####

ssdc.hostname can be specified as a hostname or IP address (as shown.)

Lastly, open hook.py in a text editor and comment out the supplied functions
getCustomUIActions and customUIAction so they look like:

  # def getCustomUIActions( ):
  #     return ()

...

  # def customUIAction( info, userData ):
  #     pass

Then add a line either after what you just commented out or to the very end of
the file:

  execfile("/usr/discreet/flame_2016.2/python/smartscope-control.py")

again replacing 'flame_2016.2' with the proper directory name based on your setup,
or if you decided to put the script somewhere else entirely, replace the whole
pathname with the correct location as appropriate.

(NOTE: If you already have existing custom context menu hooks, you'll ignore
everything above and have to just manually integrate the code from the hooks in
smartscope-flame.py into your existing hooks and make it work.)

Now restart Flame or press Shift-Control-H-P to reload the Python hooks.
Right-click somewhere on the Flame desktop (in the Player, Reels, Freeform view,
etc) to pull up the context menu and you should now have a "SmartScope Duo" entry
at the bottom.
